# Code Refactor Starter Code
<h2> Homework-Project-1 </h2>
<p> In this homework challenge I sorted through the HTML code as well as the CSS code to clean out unneeded sequences as well as simplify the code chain. </p>

<h3>What exactly was fixed</h3>
<p>
There were severa 'div' placements throughout the HTML code that I ended up renaming just the clean up and organize each part of the site. referances can be seen on lines 11 & 26, or 28 & 50.</p>

<p> In the style.css code, I renamed come classes and cleaned out code that was repetitive and made things easier to read as a developer. In the style.css code, you will also find some notes to better help direct future developers.</p>
